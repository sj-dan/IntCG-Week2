# Week 3 Activity

## What Was Done
1. **Modified Original Code**  
   Took the posted code, added Toggles in the Properties section for all 3 choices.

2. **Conditional rendering**
   Added those toggles to `CBUFFER_START` so that they can be used to conditionally add Ambient, Diffuse, and/or Specular to the `finalColor` variable.

4. **Add all 8 combinations as Materials**  
   Added Materials showcasing all 8 possible combinations of the shader, and GameObjects showcasing each version.
